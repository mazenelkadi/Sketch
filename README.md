# Sketch

The script processes an image to create a grayscale version and a pencil sketch version. It performs the following steps:

- Reads an image from a specified path.
- Converts the image to grayscale.
- Inverts the grayscale image.
- Applies Gaussian blur to the inverted grayscale image.
- Divides the grayscale image by the blurred image to achieve the pencil sketch effect.
- Displays the original image and the pencil sketch.
- Waits for a key press to close the image windows.
- Saves the grayscale image and pencil sketch to specified file paths.

This script can be used to create artistic pencil sketch effects from photographs or other images.
